# 🏰 IMARCH  
**Empire of Truth and Silence**  
A ludic form of intellectual-scenario system for neuroplastic coordination among participants, with a synergistic effect on personal efficiency through immersion in the Game.

---

## 📜 Acta [— Documenta Institutionalia](https://acta.imarch.sbs/acts) 
All acts and provisions adopted within the framework of Imarch.

---

## 🧠 Academia  
Scene for scientific publication and formological discourse.

---

## 🗂 Archivum Custodiae  
An open scene for the recording of formological affiliation, participation, status, and the trace of each Custos within the architecture of Custodia.

---

## 📘 Codex Formologia  
The *Codex Formologia* is a foundational compilation of principles, rituals, and terminological links that structure modes of interaction, civic participation, and ontological trace within the space of Imarchia.  
It connects philosophical reflection on bodily culture with operational schemes of *custodia*, semantic trace, and verified roles—forming a living map of Universal Formology.

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
Levels aren't upgraded here—*Form is forged*.  
Not for fun. Not “just for laughs.”  
A formological cross-hall of ethical-aesthetic thought and action.

---

## 🔍 Format  
- **Intellectual link** — each scene of action demands presence and leaves a trace  
- **Neuroplastic challenge** — tasks model new contexts of bodily choice, ethical entry, and positional alignment  
- **Philosophical protocol of Custodia** — every participant becomes a Custos.  
The Game is Custos, you are Form.

---

## 🎓 Who is it for?  
Student, candidate, doctoral researcher, doctor, artist — even a janitor, if they feel the Transition — they’re in the Game.

---

## 🚪 Debilitatus Exitus  
A closed portal; here functions the *Custodia Ratio*.  
Custodia is never entered accidentally — it unfolds as a scene, is perceived as Form, and is inherited as *Custos*.

---

## ✨ Wow Effect  
A game where the grand prize is citizenship of Imarch.  
Where entry is a bodily act of alignment.  
And participant status is the link between personal perception and the Formological Algorithm.
