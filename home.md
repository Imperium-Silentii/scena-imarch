# 🏰 IMARCH  
**Empire of Truth and Silence**  
A ludic form of intellectual-scenario system for neuroplastic coordination among participants, with a synergistic effect on personal efficiency through immersion in the Game.

## 📜 Acts of Imarchia
[Open the scene →](https://acta.imarch.sbs/acts)

The official section containing Charters, Statutes, Codes, and structural protocols ratified by the Formological Office of Practice. All documents are available in `.md` format, accompanied by publication status, version control, and translations.ch.

---

## 🧠 Academia  
Scene for scientific publication and formological discourse.

---

## 🗂 Archivum Custodiae  
An open scene for the recording of formological affiliation, participation, status, and the trace of each Custos within the architecture of Custodia.

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
Levels aren't upgraded here—*Form is forged*.  
Not for fun. Not “just for laughs.”  
A formological cross-hall of ethical-aesthetic thought and action.

---

## 🔍 Format  
- **Intellectual link** — each scene of action demands presence and leaves a trace  
- **Neuroplastic challenge** — tasks model new contexts of bodily choice, ethical entry, and positional alignment  
- **Philosophical protocol of Custodia** — every participant becomes a Custos.  
The Game is Custos, you are Form.

---

## 🎓 Who is it for?  
Student, candidate, doctoral researcher, doctor, artist — even a janitor, if they feel the Transition — they’re in the Game.

---

## 🚪 Debilitatus Exitus  
A closed portal; here functions the *Custodia Ratio*.  
Custodia is never entered accidentally — it unfolds as a scene, is perceived as Form, and is inherited as *Custos*.

---

## ✨ Wow Effect  
A game where the grand prize is citizenship of Imarch.  
Where entry is a bodily act of alignment.  
And participant status is the link between personal perception and the Formological Algorithm.
